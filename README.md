It is an Android Application of the SMART-GH Web-application (https://github.com/DIVERSIFY-project/SMART-GH).

# How to install

Begin by following the instructions to install and run the SMART-GH Web-application here: https://github.com/DIVERSIFY-project/SMART-GH/blob/master/docs/How-to-install-SMART-GH

We recommend you use Android Studio (At least 1.1.0) to install and run project.

Clone this repo into a new project and the application should install and run without any problems. 
Use a Virtual Device supporting at least Android 5.0. 

Now your app will be able to mark any route in the greater Dublin Region!

*If the maps do not work for you, ensure your Android Virtual Device uses an SD with enough memory*

Firstly, touch on the gear on the top right of the first screen and enter the server address to be the url of the web-app that should still be running locally + "/route/".
